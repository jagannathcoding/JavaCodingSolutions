Hint
A peak element in a 2D grid is an element that is strictly greater than all of its adjacent neighbors to the left, right, top, and bottom.

Given a 0-indexed m x n matrix mat where no two adjacent cells are equal, find any peak element mat[i][j] and return the length 2 array [i,j].

You may assume that the entire matrix is surrounded by an outer perimeter with the value -1 in each cell.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(m log(n)) or O(n log(m)) time.

 

Example 1:



Input: mat = [[1,4],[3,2]]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Both 3 and 4 are peak elements so [1,0] and [0,1] are both acceptable answers.
Example 2:



Input: mat = [[10,20,15],[21,30,14],[7,16,32]]
Output: [1,1]
Explanation: Both 30 and 32 are peak elements so [1,1] and [2,2] are both acceptable answers.
