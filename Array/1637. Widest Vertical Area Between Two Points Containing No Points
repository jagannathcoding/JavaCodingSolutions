Hint
Given n points on a 2D plane where points[i] = [xi, yi], Return the widest vertical area between two points such that no points are inside the area.

A vertical area is an area of fixed-width extending infinitely along the y-axis (i.e., infinite height). The widest vertical area is the one with the maximum width.

Note that points on the edge of a vertical area are not considered included in the area.

 

Example 1:

â€‹
Input: points = [[8,7],[9,9],[7,4],[9,7]]
Output: 1
Explanation: Both the red and the blue area are optimal.
Example 2:

Input: points = [[3,1],[9,0],[1,0],[1,4],[5,3],[8,8]]
Output: 3
 

Constraints:

class Solution {
    public int maxWidthOfVerticalArea(int[][] points) 
    {
          Arrays.sort(points, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));

           for(int i=1;i<points.length;i++)
           {
               max=Math.max(max,points[i][0] - points[i - 1][0]);
           }
           return max;
    }
