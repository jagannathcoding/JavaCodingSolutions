Hint
You are given a string s.

Your task is to remove all digits by doing this operation repeatedly:

Delete the first digit and the closest non-digit character to its left.
Return the resulting string after removing all digits.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc"

Output: "abc"

Explanation:

There is no digit in the string.

Example 2:

Input: s = "cb34"

Output: ""

Explanation:

First, we apply the operation on s[2], and s becomes "c4".

Then we apply the operation on s[1], and s becomes "".

 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 100
s consists only of lowercase English letters and digits.
The input is generated such that it is possible to delete all digits.

//tc:o(n)
//sc:o(n)

class Solution {
    public String clearDigits(String s) {
        Stack<Character>st=new Stack<>();
        
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (c>='0'&&c<='9'&&!st.isEmpty())
            {
                st.pop();
             
            } 
            else 
            {
                
                st.push(c);
            }
        }
            
        
        StringBuilder sb=new StringBuilder();
        while(!st.isEmpty())sb.append(st.pop());
        sb.reverse();
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
