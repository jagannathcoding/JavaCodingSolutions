Hint
A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in a single file line in non-decreasing order by height. Let this ordering be represented by the integer array expected where expected[i] is the expected height of the ith student in line.

You are given an integer array heights representing the current order that the students are standing in. Each heights[i] is the height of the ith student in line (0-indexed).

Return the number of indices where heights[i] != expected[i].

 

Example 1:

Input: heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
heights:  [1,1,4,2,1,3]
expected: [1,1,1,2,3,4]
Indices 2, 4, and 5 do not match.
Example 2:

Input: heights = [5,1,2,3,4]
Output: 5
Explanation:
heights:  [5,1,2,3,4]
expected: [1,2,3,4,5]
All indices do not match.
Example 3:

Input: heights = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 0
Explanation:
heights:  [1,2,3,4,5]
expected: [1,2,3,4,5]
All indices match.
 

Constraints:

1 <= heights.length <= 100
1 <= heights[i] <= 100
