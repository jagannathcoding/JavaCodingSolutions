Hint
You are given a binary array nums (0-indexed).

We define xi as the number whose binary representation is the subarray nums[0..i] (from most-significant-bit to least-significant-bit).

For example, if nums = [1,0,1], then x0 = 1, x1 = 2, and x2 = 5.
Return an array of booleans answer where answer[i] is true if xi is divisible by 5.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1,1]
Output: [true,false,false]
Explanation: The input numbers in binary are 0, 01, 011; which are 0, 1, and 3 in base-10.
Only the first number is divisible by 5, so answer[0] is true.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,1,1]
Output: [false,false,false]

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
nums[i] is either 0 or 1.

  

  class Solution {
    public List<Boolean> prefixesDivBy5(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        List<Boolean> result = new ArrayList<>(n);

        int remain = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            remain = (remain * 2 + nums[i]) % 5;
            result.add(remain == 0);
        }

        return result;
    }
}
