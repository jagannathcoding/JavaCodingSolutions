Companies

You are given a string s and a character c. Return the total number of 
substrings
 of s that start and end with c.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abada", c = "a"

Output: 6

Explanation: Substrings starting and ending with "a" are: "abada", "abada", "abada", "abada", "abada", "abada".

Example 2:

Input: s = "zzz", c = "z"

Output: 6

Explanation: There are a total of 6 substrings in s and all start and end with "z".


//tc:o(n)
//sc:o(1)

class Solution {
    public long countSubstrings(String s, char c) {
        long previousCount=0;
        long cnt=0;
        for(char ch:s.toCharArray())
        {
            if(ch==c)
            {
                cnt=cnt+1;
                cnt=cnt+previousCount;
                previousCount++;
            }
        }
        return cnt;
    }
}
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s and c consist only of lowercase English letters.
