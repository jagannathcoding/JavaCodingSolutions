Hint
Given a string s consisting only of characters a, b and c.

Return the number of substrings containing at least one occurrence of all these characters a, b and c.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabc"
Output: 10
Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "abc", "abca", "abcab", "abcabc", "bca", "bcab", "bcabc", "cab", "cabc" and "abc" (again). 
Example 2:

Input: s = "aaacb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "aaacb", "aacb" and "acb". 
Example 3:

Input: s = "abc"
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

3 <= s.length <= 5 x 10^4
s only consists of a, b or c characters.

//T.C : O(2*n) ~ O(n)
//S.C : O(1)


class Solution {
    public int numberOfSubstrings(String s) {
        int l = s.length();
        int result = 0;
        int num[]=new int[3];

        int i=0,j=0;
        while(j<l)
        {
            char ch=s.charAt(j);
            num[ch-'a']++;
            while(num[0]>0&&num[1]>0&&num[2]>0)
            {
                result+=l-j;
                num[s.charAt(i)-'a']--;
                i++;
            }
            j++;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
