Hint
Given a string s consisting only of characters a, b and c.

Return the number of substrings containing at least one occurrence of all these characters a, b and c.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabc"
Output: 10
Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "abc", "abca", "abcab", "abcabc", "bca", "bcab", "bcabc", "cab", "cabc" and "abc" (again). 
Example 2:

Input: s = "aaacb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "aaacb", "aacb" and "acb". 
Example 3:

Input: s = "abc"
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

3 <= s.length <= 5 x 10^4
s only consists of a, b or c characters.

class Solution {
    public int numberOfSubstrings(String s) {
        
        int res=0;
        int r=0;
        int arr[]=new int[3];
        Arrays.fill(arr,-1);
        while(r<s.length())
        {
            arr[s.charAt(r)-'a']=r;
            if(arr[0]!=-1&&arr[1]!=-1&&arr[2]!=-1)
            {
                int minPos=Math.min(arr[0],Math.min(arr[1],arr[2]));
                res=res+1+minPos;
            }
            r++;
        }
        return res;
    }
